abstract="We propose a standard problem to evaluate product-line methodologies. It relies on common knowledge from Computer Science, so that domainknowledge can be easily acquired, and it is complex enough to expose the fundamental concepts of product-line methodologies. As a reference point, we present a solution to this problem using the GenVoca design methodology. We explain a series of modeling, implementation, and benchmarking issues that we encountered, so that others can understand and compare our solution with theirs.",

    abstract = "A possible explanation for the impressive performance of masked language model (MLM) pre-training is that such models have learned to represent the syntactic structures prevalent in classical NLP pipelines. In this paper, we propose a different explanation: MLMs succeed on downstream tasks almost entirely due to their ability to model higher-order word co-occurrence statistics. To demonstrate this, we pre-train MLMs on sentences with randomly shuffled word order, and show that these models still achieve high accuracy after fine-tuning on many downstream tasks{---}including tasks specifically designed to be challenging for models that ignore word order. Our models perform surprisingly well according to some parametric syntactic probes, indicating possible deficiencies in how we test representations for syntactic information. Overall, our results show that purely distributional information largely explains the success of pre-training, and underscore the importance of curating challenging evaluation datasets that require deeper linguistic knowledge.",

careful comparison between different approaches is challenging. Training is
computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes,
and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the
final results. We present a replication study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et
al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and
training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can
match or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best
model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results
highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise
questions about the source of recently reported improvements. We release our

  abstract = {With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment setting, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.},

    abstract = "Pretrained contextualized embeddings are powerful word representations for structured prediction tasks. Recent work found that better word representations can be obtained by concatenating different types of embeddings. However, the selection of embeddings to form the best concatenated representation usually varies depending on the task and the collection of candidate embeddings, and the ever-increasing number of embedding types makes it a more difficult problem. In this paper, we propose Automated Concatenation of Embeddings (ACE) to automate the process of finding better concatenations of embeddings for structured prediction tasks, based on a formulation inspired by recent progress on neural architecture search. Specifically, a controller alternately samples a concatenation of embeddings, according to its current belief of the effectiveness of individual embedding types in consideration for a task, and updates the belief based on a reward. We follow strategies in reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of the controller and compute the reward based on the accuracy of a task model, which is fed with the sampled concatenation as input and trained on a task dataset. Empirical results on 6 tasks and 21 datasets show that our approach outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance with fine-tuned embeddings in all the evaluations.",

These recommendations rest on a greater recognition of the relationships between language and social hierarchies, encouraging researchers and practitioners to articulate their conceptualizations of {``}bias{''}---i.e., what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why, as well as the normative reasoning underlying these statements{---}and to center work around the lived experiences of members of communities affected by NLP systems, while interrogating and reimagining the power relations between technologists and such communities.",

Several recent works tackle this problem, and propose methods for significantly reducing this gender bias in word embeddings, demonstrating convincing results. However, we argue that this removal is superficial. While the bias is indeed substantially reduced according to the provided bias definition, the actual effect is mostly hiding the bias, not removing it. The gender bias information is still reflected in the distances between {``}gender-neutralized{''} words in the debiased embeddings, and can be recovered from them. We present a series of experiments to support this claim, for two debiasing methods. We conclude that existing bias removal techniques are insufficient, and should not be trusted for providing gender-neutral modeling.",

  abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling.An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

  abstract = {We are witnessing an increasing interest in building recommender systems (RSs) for all sorts of Software Engineering activities. Modelling is no exception to this trend, as modelling environments are being enriched with RSs that help building models by providing recommendations based on previous solutions to similar problems in the same domain. However, building a RS from scratch requires considerable effort and specialized knowledge. To alleviate this problem, we propose an automated approach to the generation of RSs for modelling languages. Our approach is model-based, and we provide a domain-specific language called Droid to configure every aspect of the RS (like the type and features of the recommended items, the recommendation method, and the evaluation metrics). The RS so configured can be deployed as a service, and we offer out-of-the-box integration of this service with the EMF tree editor. To assess the usefulness of our proposal, we present a case study on the integration of a generated RS with a modelling chatbot, and report on an offline experiment measuring the precision and completeness of the recommendations.},

  abstract = {Practitioners often encounter computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems to be solved in a variety of real-world applications. On the purpose of challenging these problems, we propose a new surrogate-based multiobjective optimization algorithm that does not require a large evaluation budget. It is called Multiobjective Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (MOTPE) and is an extension of the tree-structured Parzen estimator widely used to solve expensive single-objective optimization problems. Our empirical evidences reveal that MOTPE can approximate Pareto fronts of many benchmark problems better than existing methods with a limited budget. In this paper, we discuss furthermore the influence of MOTPE configurations to understand its behavior.},
